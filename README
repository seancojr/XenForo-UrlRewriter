UrlRewriter is a XenForo application to allow forum owners to enable auto media embed functionality and to implement affiliate schemes.

XenForo [url] tags are rewritten at the time of render, which adds a slight processing overhead (whilst XenForo does not have a post_parsed cache) but does mean that the underlying post is unmodified = this application will not edit anything in your database and is guaranteed to be non-damaging in any way.

To install:

1) Upload the UrlRewriter directory into your XenForo /library/ directory on your web server.

2) In your Admin Dashboard under Home > Add-ons > Install Add-on, browse to the addon_UrlRewriter.xml and click "Install Add-on".

To test that it's working, just create a post on the forum with this URL in the body:

NOTE: For the affiliate schemes you should edit the replacements to insert your tracking tag. When this addon has matured a little an interface will be provided for you to do this without having to edit the code.




Do you want to submit a URL rewrite definition for a site? Then this is what we need:

1) A regular expression that will take the URL and match URLs for your given site:

i.e.: http://www.gpsies.com/map.do\?fileId=([\w\d_-]+)

2) Some HTML to replace that with:

i.e.: <a href="[URL]">[NAME]</a><br /><iframe src="http://www.gpsies.com/mapOnly.do?fileId=${1}" width="[WIDTH]" height="[HEIGHT]" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"></iframe>

You have at your disposal these values:

* [URL] = The original pre-processed URL
* [NAME] = The bit of text that would've appeared between the <a> tags </a>.
* [WIDTH] = The hard-coded default width for all embeds = 425
* [HEIGHT] = The hard-coded default height for all embeds = 300

3) An example test URL:

i.e.: http://www.gpsies.com/map.do?fileId=ckhtmmzhuivpjgdi
